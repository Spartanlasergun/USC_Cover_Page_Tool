# USC_Cover_Page_Tool (University of the Southern Caribbean)

![Cover_Image](https://github.com/Spartanlasergun/USC_Cover_Page_Tool/blob/main/Readme_Image.png)

```
The entire program is just a single python file - "USC Cover Page Tool.py". 

The executable file can run on its own and does not have any other dependencies in this repository.

The file "app_icon.ico" is used to add a icon to the window of the program. The "Readme_Image.png" file adds an image to the readme file.
```

Note: This is a project I worked on a while back when I was an undergraduate doing my psychology degree. The docx module in python is not updated so there may
be compatability issues with later version of microsoft word. This is a free project - but I expect that it is only relevant to students at the University of the 
Southern Caribbean. Nevertheless, feel free to use the code as you desire.
