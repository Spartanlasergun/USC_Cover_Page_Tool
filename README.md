# USC_Cover_Page_Tool
Simple Cover Page Creation Tool
The independent executable download can be also be found here: https://archive.org/details/usc-cover-page-tool


The entire program is just a single python file - "USC Cover Page Tool.py". 
The executable file can run on its own and does not have any other dependencies in this repository.
The file "app_icon_3.png" is used to add a icon to the window of the program.

Note: Since the icon exists as a dependency on freezing of the code, it is ommited
      to ensure that the program executable can be moved from folder to folder as 
      desired. Nonetheless, it is included in the code above.
